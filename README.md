# kaggle_optiver_competition
A few Python scripts from my participation in the Optiver Kaggle Competition

validation_notebook is the script I used to validate my models

final-submission in the script I used to submit my model predcitions on the test set

If anybody can help me understand why my test results sucked compared to my CV results that would be appreciated
